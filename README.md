## About Me
I am passionate about **applied biology** and have a strong academic foundation in the field. I graduated with a BSc from **Hebrew University of Jerusalem (HUJI)**, where I worked in [Prof. Dror Sharon's lab](https://drorsharon1.wixsite.com/the-sharon-lab), and am currently pursuing my MSc. at **Prof. Naama Barkai's Lab**. I specialize in understanding biological systems through advanced experimental and computational approaches.

You can learn more about the lab I work in here:  
[Prof. Naama Barkai's Lab](https://barkailab.wixsite.com/barkai) | [Weizmann Institute of Science](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/pages/)

### Background
I have hands-on experience in:
- **Human cell culture**  
- **Cloning**  
- **RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)**  
- **Data analysis**  

My research combines both wet-lab techniques and bioinformatics to tackle questions in applied biology.
